# Gesture-Recognition
A computer vision-based project that recognizes hand gestures using **machine learning** model.  
This system can be integrated into applications such as touchless interfaces, sign language translation, or human-computer interaction.

ðŸ“Œ Features
- Real-time gesture detection using a webcam or video feed
- Preprocessing of hand landmarks for robust detection
- Model trained to recognize multiple gestures (e.g., thumbs up, palm, fist, etc.)
- High accuracy with low latency for smooth performance
